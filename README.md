# Bounding_Box
Getting scripts together to be able to translate bounding boxes from online GeoCore metadata into geoJSON files.
In this script the GeoJSON available online through the catalogue (GeoCore format) translates into a Look-
Up-Table to be used to guide the next scripts through translating the new table into GeoJSON with new spatial coordinates
representing the bounding boxes of the layers with better representation than 4 points.
